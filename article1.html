    <p><b>Alana, Danielle and Este</b> -the three sisters who make up the Los Angeles pop rock band Haim, are famous for their hugs. When we meet them and their stylist, Rebecca Grice, at the Amastan hotel in Paris’s 8th Arrondissement, they’ve got one for everyone, publicists and photographer included. Their hugs are warm, confident and genuine - just like the women themselves. Music and fashion have been part of the sisters’ lives for as long as they can remember. They grew up performing, Partridge Family with their parents in a cover band called Rockinhaim. They formed Haim in 2007, taking a break for various projects before regrouping in 2012. The release of their debut album, 2013’s Days Are Gone, catapulted them to international fame, hitting No.1 in the UK its first week. Stevie Nicks became a mentor. Taylor Swift became a friend. As a group, their look is harmonious, yet each sister gravitates towards different silhouettes.</p><br>

    <p>     Thirty-one year-old Este, the bassist, wears a lot of mini skirts and wrap dresses from Réalisation. Danielle, the 28-year old lead vocalist and guitar ist, says she feels most comfortable in trousers and slouchy suits.“And I kind of run in between,” says 25-year old Alana, who plays guitar, keyboard and percussion. All three have beautiful, sunkissed hair, which they wear centre parted in loose waves, suffusing them with an aura of 1970s California. (It’s the subject of more than a few Pinterest boards.) Clothes play a big role on tour. “We want to wear things that make us feel like the superhero versions of ourselves,” explains Danielle. “Being on stage it’s so important to feel like your best self, because it brings out the performance.”</p><br>
    <blockquote>“We want to wear things that make us feel like the superhero versions of ourselves [...] Being on stage it’s so important to feel like your best self, because it brings out the performance.”</blockquote><br>
    <p> For Haim, a love of fashion came early - fuelled by an admiration for ‘90s grunge icons like Kate Moss, a style-conscious high school (“People in our high school were pretty cool, they wore Dr. Martens in 2004,” remembers Alana) as well as runway photos on Vogue. “We would always look at collections,” Danielle says. “Obviously we couldn't afford that growing up, but we would go to thrift stores and vintage stores and try to find similar pieces. And it really allowed us to experiment in fashion.” On Sundays, they would wake up at 6 a.m. and head down to the dollar sale at Jet Rag. “It’s this thing where you have to wake up at like 6 in the morning and you have to wait–” “Basically like The Hunger Games,” says Danielle. “But it’s like incredible vintage clothing from around the U.S. and everything is a dollar,” continues Alana. “So for us in high school where we had no money, it was a gold mine.”
“Our parents,” Este interjects, “would each give us $10—” “And we would get 10 things!” they say together, laughing. Always, they were on the hunt for T-shirts and denim. “We’ve always been Levi’s girls,” says Danielle. The Pasadena Rose Bowl Flea Market was, and continues to be, another favourite stop.</p>

<p> Although she had two style-conscious older sisters, Alana says it wasn’t until sophomore year of high school that she started to develop a sense of style. “There are pictures of me on the internet that I wish would never have surfaced,” she says, citing a gingham-shirt-with-pigtails phase as particularly cringe-worthy.
“There were some questionable outfits,” Este admits. “Now,” says Alana, “we know what our bodies look good in, which is I think the hardest thing you can ever learn.” Orignal article by <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/haim-vogue-interview"</a>VOGUE UK</p>
